# Dapper and Entity Framework Core in .NET 6
+ This repository contains examples that show how to use Dapper and Entity Framework Core together in the same application.
+ Dapper is simpler than EF Core because it uses raw SQL queries and has fewer features. However, EF Core provides a higher-level abstraction over the database and has more features. Dapper supports many databases, including SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
